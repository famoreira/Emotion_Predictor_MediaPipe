2022-07-31,Remmington Jensen,"Decent enough food but absolutely horrible service, they give priority to their take out orders and even though the dine in is dead you sit around waiting forever, we ordered drinks and food and they brought the drinks out after we had finished eatting. Definitely won't be going back."

2021-10-29,Bec Elle,I was really put off by the service of this restaurant. There was at least 4 girls working and it took over 30 minutes to order. They gave us dirty plates and never cleared away the appetizer dishes when we were finished leaving no room for …More

2020-10-29,David,Buddy told me to try their lobster satay pho. Had to wait 30 mins for it. Broth was nothing special... Tasted like someone just took a tin of the canned satay sauce and mixed it with water. Noodles were stuck together and the lobster tail was fishy tasting. Not worth it for $20.

2022-06-01,Stephen Slugg,Man. Im torn. First time there today. Seemed to be some real service issues. I waited about an extra 0.5 hr for my sub. On top of the initial wait. But i can say. Met the owner. Seemed like a great fellow. And the final product? My beef satay sub? Turned out great. Salvaged the visit
2021-10-29,Craig Portell,Awesome service! Servers came to our table multiple times to ask if we needed anything. The food was DELICIOUS! The Ban Mi was scrumptious!

2019-10-30,C B,"I ordered the beef saté sub. Wow. So much meat! Great value and flavours. The bun was perfectly toasted, but not too crusty. The only problem was that I got chicken instead. Delicious! I will definitely be going there again."

2022-05-02,Jason Klapak,"Seated and ignored for 20 minutes and then left without anyone saying a word.. What more needs to be said. If I could rate lower than one star I would. 25 minutes of my life I can’t get back… 20 minutes of being ignored and the 5 minutes to post this review.  If you like food, go somewhere else where they might serve you some."

2017-10-30,Heather Collette,Their sate broth was really delicious. I didn't love the spring rolls as they lacked flavour and seemed dry. We think they did a double fry- once to cook and second time when someone orders it (flash fry) to warm them up. However service was wonderful and the soup was tasty!
2022-07-31,Tristan Gervacio,Took longer than 40 mins and my food  never arrived. Never coming back....
2020-10-29,Jayson Kang,"Saigon maxim is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best, phở noodle restaurants in Calgary. The quality of their broth, noodles, and service were all exceptional.
